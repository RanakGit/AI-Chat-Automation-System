 original code is Python (using PyAutoGUI, OpenAI API, etc.), but to create a web-based interface that you can host and show on LinkedIn, I built it in React since:

Web hosting - React apps can be easily hosted on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages
Better UI - Web technologies allow for much more creative and interactive interfaces
Shareable - You can share a URL that anyone can click and view
